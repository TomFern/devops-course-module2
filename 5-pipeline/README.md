# Module 3 - CI pipeline

**Goal**: implement all the tests in a CI pipeline

## Steps

1. Add this project to your Semaphore account
2. Create a pipeline with 4 blocks:
   - Install dependencies
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
3. Ensure the pipeline runs without errors

Check pipeline.png in this directory to see an example.

Optionally, if you have time you may implement optimization techniques discussed on Module 1
