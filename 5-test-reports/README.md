# Module 3 - Monitor errors with test reports

**Goal**: Test test reports in Semaphore

## Steps

1. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `pytest` and see that some tests are failing. This is ok.
3. Run `pytest -junitxml=reports.xml` to create an XML file with the reports
4. During exercise 6, configure Semaphore to parse test reports
5. Check instructions on exercise 6 to complete this exercise
